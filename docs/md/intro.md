# Welcome to the documentation for PyGOM

## What does this package do?

PyGOM (Python Generic ODE Model) is a Python package which provides a simple interface for users to construct Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, with a focus on compartmental models and epidemiology.
This is backed by a comprehensive and easy to use toolâ€“box implementing functions to easily perform common operations such as parameter estimation and solving for deterministic or stochastic time evolution.
The package source is freely available (hosted on [Github](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/pygom)) and organized in a way that permits easy extension. With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible), the end user is freed to focus on model development.
