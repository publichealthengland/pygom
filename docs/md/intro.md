# Welcome to the documentation for PyGOM

## What does this package do?

PyGOM (Python Generic ODE Model) is a Python package which provides a simple interface to easily construct systems
governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), with a focus on compartmental models and epidemiology.
This is backed by a comprehensive and easy to use toolâ€“box which implements functions to easily perform common operations for ODE
systems such as solving, parameter estimation, and stochastic simulation.
The package source is freely available (hosted on [Github](https://github.com/PublicHealthEngland/pygom)) and organized in a way that permits easy extension. With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible), the end user is freed to focus on model development.

<!---
The purpose of this package is to allow the end user to easily define a
set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and obtain information
about the ODEs by invoking the the appropriate methods. Here, we define
the set of ODEs as

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{y}}{\mathrm{d} t} = f(\mathbf{y},\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where $\mathbf{y} = \left(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}\right)$ is the state vector and $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\ldots, \theta_{p}\right)$ the set of parameters. Currently, this package allows the user to find the algebraic
expression of the ODE, Jacobian, gradient and forward sensitivity of the
ODE. A numerical output is given when all the state and parameter values
are provided. Note that the only important class is
{class}`.DeterministicOde` where all the
functionality described previously are exposed.
