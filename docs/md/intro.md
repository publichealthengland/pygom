# Welcome to the documentation for PyGOM

PyGOM (Python Generic ODE Model) is a Python package that aims to facilitate the application of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the real world, 
with a focus in epidemiology.  
This package helps the user define their ODE system in an intuitive manner and provides convenience functions - 
making use of various algebraic and numerical libraries in the backend - that can be used in a straight forward fashion.

This is an open source project hosted on [Github](https://github.com/PublicHealthEngland/pygom). 

A manuscript containing a shortened motivation and use is hosted on [arxXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06934).
