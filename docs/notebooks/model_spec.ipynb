    "# Defining a system of differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point, when using PyGOM to study a system of differential equations (DE's), is to encapsulate the relevant information into a class {class}`.SimulateOde`.\n",
    "Once defined as an instance of this class, the system is ready for the application of PyGOM's various features such as simulation and parameter fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Whilst the following section is quite long and involves some mathematics, we recommend not skipping it since there can be subtleties when it comes to correctly defining a model and these need to be precisely communicated to PyGOM.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Continuous time Markov chains\n",
    "\n",
    "We first introduce a particular kind of system called a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC).\n",
    "These commonly appear in the study of chemically reacting systems and epidemiology, where the quantities of interest typically refer to counts of something (be that molecules or people) in different compartments.\n",
    "In general, and this will be the case we consider here, the variables may not only refer to discrete quantities but could take continuous values too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CTMC, $n$ variables, $\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\left(y_{1}(t),\\ldots,y_{n}(t)\\right)$, describe the state of the system at time, $t$.\n",
    "There are $T$ different types of event (which PyGOM refers to as **Transitions**) and the effect of an event occurring is to change the state by some amount.\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, if event $j$ occurs then the variable $y_i$ changes by $\\mathcal{D}_{ij}$, which may depend on the current state, time and parameters, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\left(\\theta_{1},\\ldots, \\theta_{p}\\right)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\Delta y_i \\text{ due to event of transition type, j } = \\mathcal{D}_{ij}(\\mathbf{y}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, t)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{D}$ is a $n \\times T$ matrix.\n",
    "These events occur randomly in time and independently of each other at rates (also possibly dependent on the state of the system):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}(\\mathbf{y}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, t) = \\left(\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{y}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, t),\\ldots, \\lambda_{T}(\\mathbf{y}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}, t)\\right)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how this works with an example, consider a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model.\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "For those unfamiliar with the SIR model, an outline can be found in the {doc}`common models <common_models/SIR>` section.\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the state of the system is specified by 3 variables: $S$, $I$ and $R$.\n",
    "There are 2 types of event, infection and recovery, which occur at rates $\\frac{\\beta S I}{N}$ and $\\gamma I$ respectively.\n",
    "The result of an infection event happening is to reduce $S$ by 1, increment $I$ by 1 and leave $R$ unchanged. \n",
    "Recovery reduces $I$ by 1 and increments $R$ by 1, leaving $S$ unchanged.\n",
    "This information can be encapsulated in the framework above by the objects $\\mathbf{y}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ as:\n",

    "To fully specify the CTMC, this must be accompanied by a master equation which describes the probability that the system moves from the current state to the next.\n",
    "We omit this information here and instead just note that the system evolves according to the two independent stochastic processes: infection and recovery.\n",
    "Our SIR example is a special case in which the events involve transitions of individuals from one compartment to another, thus conserving the total number of individuals (note that the column sums of $\\mathcal{D}$ are all 0).\n",
    "However, in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each event need not effect only 2 variables.\n",
    "- Each event doesn't have to change variables by $\\pm 1$, or even by a constant amount.\n",
    "- Variables don't have to be discrete and/or positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's introduce the variable, $E$, which tracks the net economic impact of the epidemic (negative for loss and positive for gain).\n",
    "Let's assume that each infection costs a time dependent amount, $c_i=c_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}$, so that treatment becomes less expensive with time. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An infection event now causes a change in 3 variables ($S$, $I$ and $E$). These are correlated, despite not having direct flows between all of them.\n",
    "- Upon an infection, $E$ decreases by a time varying, continuous amount.\n",
    "- $E$ is not discrete and will take a negative value if any infections occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final kinds of processes we should account for are births and deaths.\n",
    "If individuals are born in a susceptible state at a rate proportional to the total fixed population, $\\mu N$, this represents a flow of people with no explicit origin in the model.\n",
    "Similarly, deaths occurring in each compartment ($S$, $I$, $R$) at rates ($\\mu S$, $\\mu I$, $\\mu R$) are flows with no explicit destination (unless we add an ``afterlife'' compartment).\n",
    "Just to increase the scope of our example model, let's further assume (rather unrealistically) that each birth contributes an amount $c_b$ to the economy.\n",

    "These are examples of a type of equation known as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's):\n",
    "a relationship between quantities and their rates of change with respect to one independent variable - in this case, time.\n",
    "In general, a set of ODE's has the form:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ denote dependent variables and parameters respectively, as previously, and $f$ is a vector function giving the rates of change of each dependent variable.\n",
    "In converting the CTMC model, these equations can be found via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "The easiest way is to supply this information directly, however, {doc}`in some cases <unroll/unrollSimple>`, it can also attempt to reverse engineer transitions if ODE's are instead supplied.\n",
    "If stochastic solutions are not required (or, indeed, the system has no underlying CTMC), then the system can be specified either in terms of ODE's or transitions (if possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of specifying our system using the transition approach is that many will find transitions a more intuitive language when thinking about compartmental models.\n",
    "Perhaps more beneficial, though, is that when building models with transitions using PyGOM, it enables the computer to do our book-keeping when converting transitions to ODE equations.\n",
    "This reduces the error of, for example, including a flow out of one state, but forgetting to include it in the recipient state.\n",
    "For example, in the case above, when indicating infections with $-\\frac{\\beta SI}{N}$ in the $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ equation, we had to remember to include the opposite sign in the $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ equation.\n",
