    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefits of using PyGOM are probably most evident when it is applied to compartmental models.\n",
    "This class of model is used to represent systems involving the transport of material (continuous or discrete) between different categories.\n",
    "These are commonly employed in epidemiology, in which humans (or animals) may flow between different disease states, but are also found in chemistry, tracking the formation of molecules, or in economics, where money may move from one sector to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To outline the key features of a compartmental model, we build on a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with examples of increasing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "For those unfamiliar with the SIR model, an outline can be found in the {doc}`common models <common_models/SIR>` section.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transitions between states\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest SIR compartmental model, individuals move from one state to another through 2 types of transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infection, which turns a Susceptible individual into an Infected one\n",
    "- Recovery, which turns an Infected individual into a Recovered one\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully specify the dynamics of the system, we must supplement these events with the rate at which they occur.\n",
    "In this case, infections occur at a rate $\\frac{\\beta S I}{N}$ and recoveries at a rate $\\gamma I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can graphically represent compartmental models using boxes (nodes) to indicate the states and arrows (directed edges) to show the transfer of individuals.\n",
    "The arrows are then annotated with the rate at which the transitions occur and it is implied that a transition event leads to the transfer of one individual."

    "### Non singular transitions\n",

    "The final feature we should account for is the magnitude of transitions.\n",
    "So far, we have only dealt with transitions which result in the state populations changing by $\\pm 1$.\n",
    "This is typically the case for epidemic compartmental models, where we are dealing with the movement of individuals.\n",
    "We could imagine scenarios, such as vaccinations being administered in batches of, say, 100, meaning that in one vaccination round 100 individuals will move from $S$ to $R$ in one go.\n",
    "Or, perhaps, if we restrict our study a cohort of twins then each birth event increments the $S$ population by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more common, however, to find these kinds of situations in the study chemical systems.\n",
    "For example, if we were tracking populations of $\\mathrm{H}_2$, $\\mathrm{O}_2$ and $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ in the synthesis of water, then one reaction results in population changes: $\\mathrm{H}_2$: -2, $\\mathrm{O}_2$: -1 and $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ +2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our SIR model, let's say we wish to track the monetary cost of the epidemic, $M$.\n",
    "With this example, we see that the magnitude of a transition need not be an integer quantity.\n",
    "If each infection costs $c$ monetary units then we must add another correlated transition to our model.\n",
    "This time, we must indicate that the transition has a different magnitude and we do so by adding a label of the amount to the arrowhead."
