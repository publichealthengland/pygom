    "The Kalman filter method assumes that two set of inputs are available - outputs from a model,and observations of at least some of these outputs. It is further assumed that both these outputs have some noise associated with them, so that neither the model outputs nor the observations are entirely reliable.The Kalman filter technique takes these two inputs and returns an output which is the most likely value of all the model variables, taking into account the uncertainty associated with both inputs."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "As described earlier the Kalmam filter method allows an estimate to be made of the most most likely variable values given both model outputs and observations. \n",
    "So, if model results are available time step by time step, and observations are available at these same time steps, then this suggests a way of applying the Kalman filter (KF) method to improve a time step by time step numerical model:\n",
    "1. Starting from model outputs at time t  -Xt say - apply the KF to get filtered results - XFt say -at time t.\n",
    "2. Use these filtered results as the starting point of another applicaton of the model over the next time step ,to get model results Xt+1\n",
    "3. Repeat step 1., now at time t+1,to get filtered results at time t+1,XFt+1 ,and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original motivation behind putting the KF method into PyGom was to allow a time varying beta to be modelled in a compartmental model. In this approach, at step 2. above beta is treated as a variable, which the KF can therefore modify, whereas in steps 1 and 3 beta is regarded as a fixed parameter. So,the KF feature has been implemented with this application in mind.\n",

In this way the code applies the methodolgy described in the earlier section\n",
