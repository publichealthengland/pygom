A generic framework for Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, especially compartmental type systems.
This package provides a simple interface for users to construct ODE models.
This is backed by a comprehensive and easy to use toolâ€“box which implements functions to easily perform
common operations for ODE systems such as parameter estimation and solving for deterministic or stochastic time evolution.
With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible),
the end user is freed to focus on model development.

Installation
============

You can download a local copy of the PyGOM source files from this GitHub repository::

$ git clone https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/pygom.git

Please be aware that there may be redundant files within the package as it is under active development.

.. note::
   The latest fully reviewed version of PyGOM will be on the master branch and
   we generally recommend that users install the version from there. However,
   the current version being prepared for release (featuring up-to-date documentation)
   is hosted on the feature/prep_doc branch.

Activate the relevant branch for installation via Git Bash, if you have been recruited to test code for the
new release then this is the feature/prep_doc branch::

$ git activate feature/prep_doc

Package dependencies can be found in the file, requirements.txt.
An easy way to install these to create a new `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ environment via::

$ conda env create -f conda-env.yml

which you should ensure is active for the installation process using

$ conda activate pygom

Alternatively, you may add dependencies to your own environment::

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are working on a Windows machine you will also need to install::

   - `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_
   - `Visual C++ <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0>`_
   - `Visual C++ Build Tools <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126>`

You should be able to install the PyGOM package via command line::

$ python setup.py install

and test that installation has completed successfully

$ python setup.py test

This will run a few test cases and can take some minutes to complete.

Documentation
=============

Documentation must be built locally and all necessary files can be found in the docs folder.
Documentation is built from the command line::

$ jupyter-book build docs

The html files will be saved in the local copy of your repository under:

$ pygom/docs/_build/html

.. note::
   Building the documentation involves running many examples in python
   which can take up to tens of minutes. Subsequent builds with these
   examples unchanged are much quicker due to caching of the code outputs.

Please be aware that if the module tests fails, then the documentation for the
package will not compile.
