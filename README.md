A generic framework for Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, especially compartmental type systems.
This package provides a simple interface for users to construct ODE models backed by a comprehensive and easy to use toolâ€“box implementing functions to easily perform common operations such as parameter estimation and solving for deterministic or stochastic time evolution.
With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible),
the end user is free to focus on model development.

## Installation

You can download a local copy of the PyGOM source files from this GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/pygom.git

Please be aware that there may be redundant files within the package as it is under active development.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest fully reviewed version of PyGOM will be on the `master` branch and we generally recommend that users install this version. However, the current version being prepared for release (featuring up-to-date documentation) is hosted on the `feature/prep-doc` branch.

When running the following command line commands, ensure that your current working directory is the one where the PyGOM source files were downloaded to. This should be found from your home directory:

    cd pygom

Activate the relevant branch for installation via Git Bash, if you have been recruited to test code for the
new release then this is the `feature/prep-doc` branch:

    git checkout feature/prep-doc

Package dependencies can be found in the file, `requirements.txt`.
An easy way to install these to create a new [conda](https://conda.io/docs) environment in Anaconda Prompt via:

    conda env create -f conda-env.yml

which you should ensure is active for the installation process using

    conda activate pygom

Alternatively, you may add dependencies to your own environment:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The final prerequisite, if you are working on a Windows machine, is that you will also need to install:
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater, which you can get with [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

You should now be able to install the PyGOM package via command line:

    python setup.py install

and test that installation has completed successfully

    python setup.py test

This will run a few test cases and can take some minutes to complete.

## Documentation

Documentation must be built locally and all necessary files can be found in the `docs` folder.
Documentation is built from the command line:

    jupyter-book build docs

The html files will be saved in the local copy of your repository under:

    pygom/docs/_build/html

You can view the documentation by opening the index file in your browser of choice:

    pygom/docs/_build/html/index.html

> [!NOTE]
> Building the documentation involves running many examples in python which can take up to 30 minutes. Subsequent builds with these examples unchanged are much quicker due to caching of the code outputs.

Please be aware that if the module tests fails, then the documentation for the package will not compile.
